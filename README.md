## Description
> A brief description of what your app will be like and why it's interesting. - Our app would mimic Spotify but would also include a forum that allows users to post and share music with one another.
> Possible questions to answer here: Can users share music? Can users interact with comments? Can artists interact with listeners? Who is this catered to?
> What is the motivation for the app? - Music apps have a lack of interaction between users. Youâ€™re usually not able to share or comment on others' music. Usually you have to use another third party app to share music with others. Therefore, we wanted to create an app that allows for users to communicate and share music to each other within the same app.
> What are the goals of the app? - The ability for listeners and artists to interact with one another within one app.
> What problem will the app solve? - The inability for users to interact with one another. 
> What form will the app take to fulfill its goals? - A web application. 
> What sorts of features will the app have? - Listening to music, creating playlists, sharing playlists, sharing music, posting on a forum, and commenting on peoples' forums.
> What are the selling points of the app? - The ability to create posts and share music within the same app. 
> What makes this app interesting/cool? - The cool feature of this app is being able to share music with friends, make a comment about certain songs, and interact with other users, all on the same app. 
> In addition, add an image or pdf document for your use-case diagram, indicating the group member responsible for each actor.
